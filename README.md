# README-Generator

## Description


  Making a README generator would make a lot of my challenges and assignments in school a lot easier and more organized.
  I built this project because I thought it would be good practice for learning more javascript as well as using it to help speed along any projects I may have in the future.
  Having the README guidelines laid out for me every time I need them would help keep me organized and help cut down any potential google searches to find the professional guidelines everytime I need to make a README
  While making my assignment I learned different functions and easier ways to handle my future work.
